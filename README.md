My entry for the 2022 gamedev.js jam

# What Is RAW?
RAW is the unrelenting rule of cool that makes no apologies for being what it is and being absolutely awesome!

RAW are also the Really Awesome Wizards - A band of awesome spellcasters driving their van across the wasteland destroying the stinking MEATS - 
Minions of Evil ATtack Squads

# RAW: Really Awesome Wizards
RAW: Really Awesome Wizards will be a turn-based RPG focused on RAW destruction - massive AoE spells that cut swathes of MEATS down!
The battles will pit our 3 wizards against hordes of 10-25 MEATS in a normal encounter, and mana is limited, so use your spells wisely!
